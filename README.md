# sudoku_test

By no means does this produce a good drupal module nor setup the proper output protocols. I just wanted a quick way to spit stuff out while I debugged the code using xdebug.

I so very much hate echo's, printf or var_dumps in code for testing. just looks so nasty. 

Anyway... fun test.
